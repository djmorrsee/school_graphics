Daniel Morrissey Assignment 06 -- Texturing

To Build: make all
To Run: ./texscene

Controls:

-Change Perspective Mode: k
-Turn Lighting On/Off: l
-Rotate/Look: Arrow Keys

The scene consists of various textured primitives. Each texture is tileable.

Each object is sized and scaled with regard to relative texture sizes (ie. so a brick looks right compared to a door).
