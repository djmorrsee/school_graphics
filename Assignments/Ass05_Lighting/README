Daniel Morrissey Assignment 05 -- Lighting 

To Build: make all
To Run: ./light_scene

Controls:

Change Perspective Mode: k

Zoom (ortho only): w/s

Rotate/Look: Arrow Keys

Turn Lighting On/Off: l

Turn Smoothing On/Off: j

Increase/Decrease Resolution: a/d

The resolution controls the vert density in the icosphere and cylinder

The light orbits the scene naturally. 

Notes:

Increasing the number of faces on the icosphere causes it to become dimmer overall. Normals appear to work fine, but there are no shiny faces at a certain resolution.

Normals are tough to get right, and I'm still not 100% sure my drawFaces method and face class handle them properly.
