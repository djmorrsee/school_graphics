I could not figure out why the printed bitmap characters
fade in and out. They appear to be following the color set in
the draw_lorenz function, however I set the color right before
calling Print, so I'm unsure how to fix it.

There was no discernable pattern when increasing or decreasing
the lorenz paramters, although r seems to be radius.

I had hoped to develop an adjustable perspective viewport,
however that exceeded the scope of what I could accomplish for this
assignment. I kept with an orthographic view instead.

RESUBMISSION NOTES

Fixed aspect ratio scaling. The visual now scales with the height of the window,
but does not stretch.

Fixed Text Color Rendering error. Calling glColor() after glWindoPos() caused
the color call to be lost.

Adjusted some parameters to make the rendered effect more visually appealing.
