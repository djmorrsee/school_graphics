I could not figure out why the printed bitmap characters
fade in and out. They appear to be following the color set in 
the draw_lorenz function, however I set the color right before
calling Print, so I'm unsure how to fix it.

There was no discernable pattern when increasing or decreasing
the lorenz paramters, although r seems to be radius.

I had hoped to develop an adjustable perspective viewport, 
however that exceeded the scope of what I could accomplish for this 
assignment.
