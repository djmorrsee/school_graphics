To build, make all
To run, ./scene

The scene was created using helper functions built up througout the assignments, found in dj_primitives.h

The pole will act as a street light if this scene has lighting introduced.

Controls:

- Rotate View with Arrow Keys
- Translate View with WSAD (W moves 'north' relative to worldspace)

Press 'k' to switch between orthographic (default) and perspective view.


Comments:

The scene is currently setup to apply global rotations after global translations.
This results in w always moving in the same direction relative to the scene.

Doing it the other way made for a sort of fist person type of control, but it would skew in extreme ways if both the position and rotation vectors were large. 

For stability, I left it as it is, and will work to get a better feeling control scheme.
