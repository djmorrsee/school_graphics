Homework 7: Image Processing
============================

## Daniel Morrissey

The purpose of this assignment was to explore the image processing capabilities
of opengl.

For my submission, I am drawing a textured monkey via ARRAY_BUFFERS 
and then applying two different edge detection algorithms depending on the shader.

	Shader 0: 
		Programmable pipeline only
		
	Shader 1:
		Laplacian edge detection shader from ex11
		
	Shader 2:
		My own edge detection algorithm
		Adapted from:
			- http://coding-experiments.blogspot.com/2010/06/edge-detection.html
	

## To Build/Run

	make all
	./main

## Controls

	- Click Mouse and Drag to move
	- +/- to zoom in and out
	- l to switch from perpective/orthogonal projection
	- m/n to switch between shader modes

## Other Operations

Data for the array buffers was parsed externally via my own python parsing script.

	python parseobj.py objfile.obj
	
Grepmake:

	./grepmake runs 'make all' and greps the output for 'warning' or 'error'

## Notes

Total time: 8 hours, put a lot into project structure, am trying to 
make my projects modular, to minimize work each subsequent week.
