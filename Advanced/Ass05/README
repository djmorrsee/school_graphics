# Assignment 05: WebGL
### Daniel Morrissey

The purpose of this assignment was to gain familiarity with the WebGL 
flavor of OpenGL. 

I used ex06 as a starting place, and heavily relied on the following 
sites for code samples:

>- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebGL

## To Run

chromium-browser --allow-file-access-from-files ass05.html

**OR**

Just open it in Firefox.

Both browsers were tested, FireFox seems to run better.

## Notes

>- Fully lit (no specular) and textured, with normals built as well.
>- Rotate the view with the mouse button, or via the Animate Box button
>- Cause the light to orbit with the Animate Light button
>- The first frame that gets displayed usually wont have textures loaded 
yet, as they are lazy loaded. Once the textures are loaded, they should 
be drawn properly.

## Other Comments
>- Perhaps its a result of the "friendliness" of javascript, but I was 
very much able to get a better grasp of how the ArrayBuffer system works 
after doing this assignment. Theres less overhead than with C.

>- Leagues easier to debug WebGL, even with shaders. Firefox proved to 
provide extremely helpful console messages, which was a nice contrast 
to things just segfaulting in the past.

>- Theres no easy way to draw axes.
