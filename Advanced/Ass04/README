#Homework 4: OpenGL 3.x +

This is a submission of an incomplete Homework. I bricked my working machine, and lost a lot of data.

The scene consists of a lit cube, completely in the programmable pipeline. A single light and diffuse shading is done.

What was lost was specular lighting, texture support as well as most of an obj loader to create Array Buffers.
